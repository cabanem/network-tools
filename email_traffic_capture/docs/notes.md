# Essential Features for Network-Level Email Diagnostic Tools

## Core Network Connectivity Features
### 1) Port and service detection
- Test if mail ports are listeing (typically 25, 587, 465, 2525)
- Identify which processes are using mail ports
- Check if services are running (like Exchange, Postfix, IIS SMTP)
- Basic TCP connectivity tests

### 2) DNS resolution testing
- MX record lookup for destination domain
- A record resolution for mail servers
- Reverse DNS (PTR) record checks
- DNS server connectivity tests

### 3) SMTP protocol testing
- Raw SMTP handshake testing (`telnet` equivalent)
- `EHLO`/`HELO` command validation
- Authentication mechanism discovery
- `TLS` / `STARTTLS` capability testing

## Traffic Analysis Features
### 4) Packet capture and analysis
- Real-time connection monitoring
- Full packet capture with conversion to readable format
- SMTP command/response parsing
- Error pattern detection (4xx, 5xx)

### 5) Queue and delivery monitoring
- Mail queue inspection
- Stuck/deferred message detection
- Delivery attempt tracking
- Performance metrics (delivery times)

## Security and Authentication
### 6) Authentication testing
- AUTH mechanism support detection
- Certificate validation for TLS
- SSL/TLS handshake analysis
- Authentication failure detection

### 7) Firewall and security checks
- Outboud connection testing
- ISP port blocking detection
- Spam filter/reputation checks
- IP blacklist verification

## Advanced Diagnostic Features
### 8) Multi-destination testing
- Test delivery to multiple providers (Gmail, Outlook, etc)
- Cross-reference deliver success rates
- Provider-specific error analysis

### 9) Historical analysis
- Log file parsing and analysis
- Trend detection over time
- Recurring error pattern identification
- Performance degradation detection

### 10) Configuration validation
- Mail server configuration checks
- Relay permission validation
- SPF/DKIM/DMARC record verification
- Certificate expiration monitoring

## Essential Output Features
### 11) Structured reporting
- Summary dashboard with pass/fail indicators
- Detailed error explanations w/remediation steps
- Export capabilities (JSON, CSV, text)
- Integration with monitoring systems

### 12) Real-time monitoring
- Live connection tracking
- Alert generation for failures
- Performance threshold monitoring
- Automated retry logic

## Sample Feature Priority Matrix
### Must-Have
- Port connectivity testing
- DNS/MX record validation
- Basic SMTP handshake testing
- Packet capture with SMTP parsing
- Queue status monitoring

### Should-Have
- TLS/SSL certificate validation
- Authentication mechanism testing
- Mail server log analysis
- Multi-provider delivery testing
- Configuration validation

# Nice-to-Have
- SPF/DKIM/DMARC validation
- IP reputation checking
- Historical trend analysis
- Integration with external monitoring
- Automated remediation suggestions

## Integration Considerations
### External Tool Integration
- `nslookup` / `dig` for DNS
- `telnet` / `nc` for connectivity
- Native packet capture tools
- Mail server specific commands (postqueue, Get-Queue)

### Cross-Platform Compatibility
- Windows (netsh, Powershell, Exchange cmdlets)
- Linux (tcpdump, postfix tools, systemctl)
- Platform-specific adaptations

### Error Classification System
- Network layer (connectivity, DNS)
- Transport layer (TCP, ports)
- Application layer (SMTP protocol)
- Security layer (TLS, authentication)
- Configuration layer (server settings, permissions)
